# Welcome to jambonz

jambonz is a self-hosted, "bring your own everything" open source CPaaS platform, developed by the creator of the [drachtio](https://drachtio.org) open source sip server.

Unlike those fancy-pants CPaaS services, jambonz is designed to be:

- **100% open source** - the entire project is public on github.com/jambonz (all of it!)
- **Easy to self-host** - one-click to run on the infrastructure of your choice
- **Privacy-centric** - customer data is never stored by the platform
- **Multi-tenant** - good for providers and larger orgs
